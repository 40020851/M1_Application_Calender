# REPORT

## Requirements
The main aim of our project is used to find the day by entering the day,month and year.
## Introduction    
A calendar is a system of organizing days. This is done by giving names to periods of time, typically days, weeks, months and years. A date is the designation of a single, specific day within such a system. The calender application presented here is a very simple console application developed using C programming language. A calendar is also a physical record (often  paper) of such a system.
## Research  
- The calendar application built without using graphics properties;instead, it utilizes many windows properties to give the application a colorful look feel.
- It is compiled in Code::Blocks using GCC compiler.
- The application is reduced as much as possible to avoid errors while entering the data.l help to displays day corresponding to a given date.
- It provides a very simple interface and display days,dates,months and years based on the input given by the user.
- As Described above can lead to error free, secure, reliable and fast application  system.
- So In this project will overcome the drawbacks of the previous project and adding some extra features.
## Features and Timeline
- ## Initial cost
  The initial cost of setting up the system will include the cost of the hardware software like systems, os, and the software
- ## Running cost
  Besides the initial cost the long term cost will include the running cost for the system including some battery backups for the systems.
         And it has cost for update/renewal of this software.
## Defining our system
- The main objective of the project is used to find the day by entering the day,month and year.
- Basically three operations can be done in this calendar application. To find out the day corresponding to a given date, the date, month and year are asked. You can list the days and dates of any month of any year.
- This application utilizes file handling and various other basic aspects of the C language.
- Editing, adding and updating days,months and years is improved.
- Be easy to understand by the user and operator.
- You can navigate the months using arrow keys, or press ‘n’ and ‘p’ keys to view the next and previous months respectively. 
- For example, entering 04 2014 (April 2014) will give you an output.
## Modules
- ## Main menu
        Used for managing the menu of the application.
- ## Add day,month,year
        Used for adding the days,months and years.
- ## Edit day,month,year
        Used for editing the days,months and years.
- ## Display
         Used for display the days,months and years.
## 4W's and 1'H
- This project is used to find the day by entering the day, month, and year.
- Calendars are useful tools for keeping track of upcoming meetings, deadlines, and milestones. They can help you visualize your schedule and remind you of important events, such as holidays and vacation time.
- - They can help you visualize your schedule and remind you of important events, such as holidays and vacation time.
- The project calendar specifies the working and non-working days and times for activities. Typically this calendar reflects the typical working hours of the company.
## SWOT Analysis
- This project will be very useful for keeping track of upcoming meeting,deadlines, and milestones.
- It specifies the work hours for each work day,the work days for each week,and any exceptions,such as holidays.
- Time efficient will be saved.
- Easy to know more about the holidays.
- This application helps you to visualize your schedule.
- Data corruption is possible,altering or even deleing events.
- Need physical access to your computer or smartphones to see schedule.
